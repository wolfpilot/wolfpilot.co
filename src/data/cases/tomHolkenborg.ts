  html: `<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Holkenborg</a>, known by his stage name as <em>Junkie XL</em>, is a Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum producer, musician, and composer. Drawing from his extensive background in electronic music and a passion for innovation, he's committed to transforming the landscape of film scoring.

    Given his diverse career, Tom needed to connect effectively with various audiences, including composers, producers, talents, and fans, using the appropriate tone and branding. The idea was to create an ecosystem that delivers a unified experience, enabling each audience to find the right pathway into Tomâ€™s world through his distinct labels.

  copy: `I would be lying if I said that I knew who Tom Holkenborg was prior to this project, so imagine my surprise when I found out he was the one behind film scores such as Zack Snyder's Justice League, Batman v Superman and Deadpool.
  
  Shaking aside all nerves, I was glad to finally get the chance to work with a subject I hold dear to my heart, and that is audio.

  Among other audio-visual features I worked on, you can find players for Tom's musical scores, Spotify integrations, and even a fun little synth-keyboard on the 404 page, should you be so (un)lucky.`,
